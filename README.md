# Regnum map tiles


Overview
- The `tiles/` folder contains 9 map tiles for a 3x3 map named by row-column: `1-1.png` ... `3-3.png`.
- This is an old map from Regnum Online (nowadays Champions of Regnum).

Requirements
- ImageMagick (install on macOS with: `brew install imagemagick`).

Notes
- The command assumes all tiles are the same size and named in row-major order.
- If you prefer a different output filename, change `map.png`.
- Verify the tile ordering before running; adjust filenames if your numbering scheme differs.
